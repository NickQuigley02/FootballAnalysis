To paraphrase the observant Jon Bois, whose video ["The search for the saddest punt in the world"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9H9LwGmc-0) inspired this project, punting is one of few plays in American Sports which is explicitly giving up. It saves you field position, but at the cost of potential points.
This project is essentially to find the opposite of the saddest punt in the world; We seek to find the stupidest, least sensible, _bravest_ 4th down decisions in modern football. This project takes every non-punt 4th down play of the NFL from 2000 to 2022, as gathered from the [ProFootball Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) database, and ranks them on an entirely arbitary mathematical function to determine the most confident plays of 21st century football.
By the end, we seek to have a list of plays where teams went for it on 4th down, when it wasn't necessary, sensible, wise, smart, reasonable or particularly beneficial, but when it was _**BOLD**_.
